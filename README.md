Information and file repository for the Joker Tool Works HCC-2A, [which you can find here.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3712294)

Due to MakerBot's failure to ensure that markdown formatting persists in Thing descriptions, I've moved critical information here. *Because I can format things here.*

# Overview
PLEASE READ THE F.A.Q. SECTION BELOW BEFORE YOU ASK QUESTIONS. I have answered hundreds of questions about this kit, and they're all answered in the five items there.

== DISCLAIMER ==

This is a Carbine Conversion Kit for AIRSOFT TOYS and cannot be modified, manipulated, or converted for use with a firearm. It cannot be modified, manipulated, or 
converted to discharge firearm ammunition.

This kit was designed for the dimensions of a Tokyo Marui Hi-CAPA 5.1. It will not fit other sizes of Hi-CAPA (4.3, 7.1, etc). It may also have fitment issues with 
non-TM branded or aftermarket upgraded models. Please read the Print Settings section for details.

==CONCEPT==

The JTW HCC-2A is the evolution of the [Hi-CAPA Carbine Version 1](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3555822). The idea of this project is to create an open-source 
Hi-Capa 5.1-compatible carbine kit for airsoft gas pistols, as there are no open source projects like this elsewhere currently. When I say open source, I MEAN open 
source – want to print your own? The files are and will forever be COMPLETELY FREE. Want to print some to sell? You’re absolutely allowed to – with 
personalization/customization/other modifications as well – if you link back to the project's Thingiverse post or this Github repository in your sale listing!

The HCC-2A has been tested for functionality but needs testing out in the field.

Notes:
PLEASE print Rail_Slot_Test.stl and Rail_Lock.stl FIRST and ensure they fit properly on your Hi-CAPA! There are many parts to this project, so please watch the 
assembly guide. This kit requires having a Tokyo Marui or derivative Hi-Capa 5.1 with the accessory rail. It will NOT work without the accessory rail! The entire kit 
is able to be printed without concern using PLA. If you really want to use a different, stronger material for specific parts, consider printing the Optic Rail, Grip 
Rail, Action Camera Mount, Charging Handle, and Stock Tang out of PETG or Nylon, as these parts support most of the strain and tension on the kit.


# Post-Processing 
[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9aYI5CcUUY) for a video describing the assembly process and an overview of the kit.

## Hardware you will need: 
* M4 Nut x13 
* M5 Nut x1 
* 18mm M4 Screw x3 
* 16mm M4 Screw x1 
* 10mm M4 Screw x3 
* 8mm M4 Screw x6 
* AEG M4 Buffer Tube w/Screw and Collar 

## Tools you will need
* Screwdriver (Hex, Phillips, or Flat depending on what screws you’re using) 
* Deburring tool 
* Sandpaper and Files 

Optional (but recommended): 
* PLA-compatible adhesive 
* Thread Locker Compound 
* 125-150% Recoil Spring - Optional (Depends on your Hi-Capa setup. If it's stock, use a stronger recoil spring.)

I recommend also using a threadlocker compound on all screws. Also, you should glue *and* screw the accessory and optic rails in place to ensure they don't move.

Some parts may require sanding/fitting because the exact accuracy of some parts is reliant upon print quality and consistency. 


# F.A.Q
Q: What kind of Hi-Capa will this fit?\
A: This kit is designed to fit a STANDARD Tokyo Marui Hi-Capa 5.1 with the included accessory rail. It will not accept ANY 
OTHER Hi-Capa model or brand. I don't have any other Hi-Capa on hand to design an adapted mount for.

Q: Can you change something for me?\
A: No. This project is finished and I'm not working on it anymore.

Q: Can I have the original files so I can edit them in Autodesk family software?\
A: The best I can do is provide .OBJ's of the original files, which can be imported into Autodesk. [You can download them here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xr46nHo7fCHXDQukNqw2PCJGJ-KtgVul?usp=sharing) I don't use Autodesk software for 3D design purposes, so I can't help you beyond that.

Q: Can I print the kit and sell it on websites such as eBay, Etsy, etc?\
A: Yes. The project is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attributions license. This means 
you just need to credit me (EasterWorks, JokerToolWorks, or Craig Easter) as the creator. Otherwise, I do not have the time to keep track of royalty fees and the 
related tax processes, so just crediting me is fine.

Q: Can I use this kit with a firearm?\
A: Check with your local and national laws to ensure you're allowed to. Functionally speaking, I wouldn't - a real gun would 
break the kit without a significant and fundamental re-design.
