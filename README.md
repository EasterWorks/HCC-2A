# HCC-2A
Information and file repository for the Joker Tool Works HCC-2A, [which you can find here.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3712294)

Due to MakerBot's failure to ensure that markdown formatting persists in Thing descriptions, I've moved critical information here.

# Post-Processing 
[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9aYI5CcUUY) for a video describing the assembly process and an overview of the kit.

## Hardware you will need: 
* M4 Nut x13 
* M5 Nut x1 
* 18mm M4 Screw x3 
* 16mm M4 Screw x1 
* 10mm M4 Screw x3 
* 8mm M4 Screw x6 
* AEG M4 Buffer Tube w/Screw and Collar 


## Tools you will need: 
* Screwdriver (Hex, Phillips, or Flat depending on what screws youâ€™re using) 
* Deburring tool 
* Sandpaper and Files - Optional (but recommended): 
* PLA-compatible adhesive 
* Thread Locker Compound 
* 125-150% Recoil Spring - Optional (Depends on your Hi-Capa setup. If it's stock, use a stronger recoil spring.)

I recommend also using a threadlocker compound on all screws. Also, you should glue *and* screw the accessory and optic rails in place to ensure they don't move.

Some parts may require sanding/fitting because the exact accuracy of some parts is reliant upon print quality and consistency. 


# F.A.Q:
Q: What kind of Hi-Capa will this fit?
A: This kit is designed to fit a STANDARD Tokyo Marui Hi-Capa 5.1 with the included accessory rail. It will not accept ANY OTHER Hi-Capa model or brand. I don't have any 
other Hi-Capa on hand to design an adapted mount for.

Q: Can you change something for me?
A: No. This project is finished and I'm not working on it anymore.

Q: Can I have the original files so I can edit them in Autodesk family software?
A: The best I can do is provide .OBJ's of the original files, which can be imported into Autodesk. [You can download them here.](https://drive.google.com/drive
/folders/1xr46nHo7fCHXDQukNqw2PCJGJ-KtgVul?usp=sharing) I don't use Autodesk software for 3D design purposes, so I can't help you beyond that.

Q: Can I print the kit and sell it on websites such as eBay, Etsy, etc?
A: Yes. The project is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attributions license. This means you just need to credit me (EasterWorks, JokerToolWorks, or Craig 
Easter) as the creator. Otherwise, I do not have the time to keep track of royalty fees and the related tax processes, so just crediting me is fine.

Q: Can I use this kit with a firearm?
A: Check with your local and national laws to ensure you're allowed to. Functionally speaking, I wouldn't - a real gun would break the kit without a significant and
fundamental re-design.
